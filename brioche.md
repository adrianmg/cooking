# Brioche

Brioche is a French sweet bread similar to a highly enriched pastry. The texture is soft and a bit fluffier than regular white bread.

### Ingredients
```
500 gr bread flour
2 eggs
2 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt
10 gr dry yeast
100 gr unsalted butter
200 ml milk (can be blended with water)
```

You will also need a `loaf pan` to shape and cook the final dough in the oven.

### Process

I'd recommend using a blender to get a more uniform dough, but you can use your own hands (although the dough gets a bit heavy).

1. Beat the `eggs` and leave a very tiny portion to brush the bread later in the process. This will add some color and texture to the top.
2. Mix the bread `flour` + `eggs` + `milk` slowly.
3. Add and mix `butter` + `sugar` + `salt` slowly.
4. Increase the blender speed until all the ingredients are well incorporated, and the dough looks uniform.
5. Cover the top and let it proof for `1 or 2 hours`.
6. Pre-heat the `oven` at `200 C` / `390 F`.
7. Place the dough on the working table, split it into three even pieces. Stretch each piece slightly, removing the air from inside, and form a cylinder shape. You can optionally fill these pieces with chocolate chips. Be mindful, adding too much filling can make the dough harder to shape.
8. Place the three pieces close to each other in the `loaf pan` and brush them with the tiny portion of the `beaten eggs`.
9. Cook it in the pre-heated oven for about 25 minutes at `200 C` / `390 F` until it gets a brownish color. Using more water instead of milk will require less time.

Enjoy your brioche!
