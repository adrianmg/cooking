### Ingredients
```
355 ml cool water
2 tbsp (25 gr) sugar
½ tsp (1.42 gr) active dry yeast
1 tbsp (6.86 gr) extra-virgin oil
500 gr of all-purpose or bread flour
1 tbsp + ½ tsp (20 gr) fine salt
```

Topping is up to you I usually go with:

```
Tomato sauce: smashed tomatoes + garlic
Oregano
Fresh mozzarella cheese
Big mushrooms
Olive-oil
Pepper powder
```

### Process

You'll prepare this dough **one day before cooking the pizza**. Although the process is lengthy, I assure you it is 100% worth it. It's by far the best homemade dough I've come across.

Having a baking stone (even if it's a $10 one) will dramatically increase and improve your dough's spring and texture.

#### Sequence

1. Find yourself a `big bowl`; we will be making dough for two pizzas, `454 gr` each. You can keep them in the fridge for a few days, don't worry.
2. Put and mix in the bow the `water` + `sugar` + `yeast` thoroughly.
3. Mix in the `olive oil`.
4. Mix in the `flour`. Take your time. Make sure everything is evenly incorporated with your hands. You can also use a blender with a dough hook for about `4-5 minutes` at slow speed.
5. After `30 minutes`, mix in the `salt`. Again, take your time to make sure things are evenly integrated. Please don't add the salt before the waiting time, and it will ruin the gluten structure.
6. Cover the bowl with a towel and let it rest for `24 hours` in the `fridge`.
7. To be continued (I'll fill in as I cook my next pizza).


Enjoy your pizza!
